# Study Drill
#
# You now have a nice piece of code that's controlling a car.
# In this study drill you're going to create a new function that creates any car.
# Your creator function should meet these requirements:
#
# It should take parameters to set things like the color, speed, or anything else
#   your cars can do.
# It should create a dict that has the correct settings, and already contains all
#   the functions you've created.
# It should return this dict so people can assign the results to anything they want
#   and use later.
# It should be written so that someone can create any number of different cars and
#   each one they make is independent.
#
# Your code should test #4 by changing settings in a few different cars and then
# confirming they didn't change in other cars.
#
# This challenge is different because I'll show you the answer to the challenge in
# a later exercise. If you struggle with this challenge then shelve it for a bit and
# move on. You'll see this again shortly.
